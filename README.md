# Bentfish

This repository contains data and code for producing spatiotemporal indicies of abundance (using the R-package `sdmTMB()`[Anderson et al. (2020)](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB)) of benthic invertebrate groups in the Baltic Sea, as well as preparing stomach data of cod and flounder. Part of bentfish project.

How to navigate this repo: 

`data`: Contains benthic data, some covariate data and cleaned data for analysis

`R`: Code for compiling data and for calculating indices

`output`: .csv files of annual spatiotemporal indices of abundance

`figures`: key figures (indices, model validation, area boundaries)

Due to size-limitations, only cleaned data are on GitHub. Stomach data is not on GitHub (contact the author for questions about data).
